            SendEmailRequest req = new SendEmailRequest() {{
                request = new Email() {{
                    bcc = "unde";
                    cc = "deserunt";
                    from = "porro";

                    replyTo = "id";
                    subject = "vero";
                    text = "perspiciatis";
                    to = "nulla";
                }};
            }};

            SendEmailResponse res = sdk.email.sendEmail(req);

            if (res.sendEmailResponse.isPresent()) {
                // handle response
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // handle exception
        }
```
<!-- End SDK Example Usage -->

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer re_123456789 where re_123456789 is your API Key. First, you need to get an API key, which is available in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/login).

```bash
Authorization: Bearer re_123
```
